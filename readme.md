# <div align="center"> BIOBSS </div>

A package for processing signals recorded using wearable sensors, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Electrodermal activity (EDA) and 3-axis acceleration (ACC). 

BIOBSS's main focus is to generate end-to-end pipelines by adding required processes from BIOBSS or other Python packages. Some preprocessing methods were not implemented from scratch but imported from the existing packages.

Main features:

- Applying basic preprocessing steps 
- Extracting features for ECG, PPG, EDA and ACC signals
- Assessing quality of PPG and ECG signals
- Performing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis using PPG or ECG signals
- Extracting respiratory signals from PPG or ECG signals and estimating respiratory rate
- Calculating activity indices from ACC signals
- Generating and saving pipelines
